# Security Policy

## Supported versions
This is a static GitHub Pages site. There is no application backend.

## Reporting a vulnerability
If you discover a security issue (e.g., XSS in generated pages, dependency risk, or misconfiguration), please:
1) **Do not** open a public issue with exploit details.
2) Contact the maintainer privately (preferred) once an email is listed on the site.

If private contact is not available yet, open an issue titled **"Security report"** and include only high-level details (no exploit steps). The maintainer will follow up.

## Response
Reasonable effort will be made to review reports and apply fixes promptly.
